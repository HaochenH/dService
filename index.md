Data science has become an essential tool for businesses and organizations to make data-driven decisions, optimize operations, and gain a competitive advantage. The field encompasses a broad range of techniques and technologies, including machine learning, statistics, and computer science. However, the rapid pace of technological change and the diverse applications of data science make it challenging for university students to stay current with the field and to understand the full scope of career opportunities available.

This problem is particularly relevant given the current global economic landscape, as the COVID-19 pandemic has led to changes in the job market and increased uncertainty for international students. According to a report by the McKinsey Global Institute, the pandemic has accelerated the shift towards digitalization and automation, leading to increased demand for data science and analytics skills. However, this demand is not evenly distributed across countries, and international students need to be aware of these regional variations in order to make informed decisions about their career development.

Especially for international students who want to legally work in the US after graduate, it's important for them to access the information of STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics) degree so that they could decide whether enter the tech industry and gain additional Optional Practical Training (OPT) opportunities. Data science is one of the promising STEM fields with opening positions available.

Currently, there is a shortage of data science professionals in the tech industry. According to employment projection data from U.S. Bureau of Statistics, the employment of data scientist is projected to grow 36% from 2021 - 2031, which is faster than the average growth rate of all other occupations (U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, 2022). This has led to high demand for individuals with data science skills and has created a significant number of job opportunities for students with a background in data science. However, students may face challenges in gaining access to comprehensive education and resources on the history and current state of data science. This limits their ability to fully grasp the opportunities and challenges within the industry, or effectively contribute to its continued growth.
