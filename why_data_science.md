## Why Data Science?

Data science has become an essential tool for various industries and applications, revolutionizing the way we understand, analyze, and utilize data.

The field encompasses a broad range of techniques and technologies, including machine learning, statistics, and computer science. However, the rapid pace of technological change and the diverse applications of data science make it challenging for university students to stay current with the field and to understand the full scope of career opportunities available.

This problem is particularly relevant given the current global economic landscape, as the COVID-19 pandemic has led to changes in the job market and increased uncertainty for international students. According to a report by the McKinsey Global Institute, the pandemic has accelerated the shift towards digitalization and automation, leading to increased demand for data science and analytics skills. However, this demand is not evenly distributed across countries, and international students need to be aware of these regional variations in order to make informed decisions about their career development.
