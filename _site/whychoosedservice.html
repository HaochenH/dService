<h1 id="why-choose-dservice">Why choose dService?</h1>

<h2 id="whats-the-need-not-being-met">What’s the need not being met?</h2>

<p>The need not being met is the need for accurate and up-to-date information about data science job opportunities and personal factors in different countries for international students interested in data science. These students are facing challenges to navigate the different job market trends and opportunities, as well as personal factors that may impact their long-term development. This need is also reinforced by the surveys and interviews with data science professionals and hiring managers, such as the “Data Science Report” by Burtch Works, which shows that data science professionals and hiring managers value not only technical skills but also knowledge of the industry and its history.</p>

<h2 id="dservice-is-here-to-help">dService is here to help.</h2>

<blockquote>
  <p>Access to Information and Resources</p>
</blockquote>

<p>We are creating a platform or resource center for international students to access information and resources on data science careers, including industry trends, job market analysis, career paths, and networking opportunities. Through our data science website, users could have an overview about the programs which provide data science educational opportunities and also career outcomes in data science. Also, we provide information on alternative paths to a data science career, such as online courses or self-study options since DS technologies are always updating and iterating, and sometimes knowledge cannot keep up with the changes of the times.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Help users Make Smart Decisions</p>
</blockquote>

<p>We are devoted to help students who are interested in data science to know more about in this field and provide reasons to choose or not to choose data science as a career. We provide information on the current state of data science industry and the reason behind it, such as the reason why the field is so volatile, why data science is dying or not.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Identifying Trends and Opportunities</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Our visualization solutions can users in identifying trends, patterns, and employment prospects of different positions in data science career by visualizing data over time. Identifying job opportunities, we could help users identify the concentrated location of jobs and decide to search for jobs by mapping the data-science-related jobs. Also, we could offer information and guidance on the job search process for international students.</p>
