## Whatâ€™s the need not being met?

The need not being met is the need for accurate and up-to-date information about data science job opportunities and personal factors in different countries for international students interested in data science. These students are facing challenges to navigate the different job market trends and opportunities, as well as personal factors that may impact their long-term development. This need is also reinforced by the surveys and interviews with data science professionals and hiring managers, such as the "Data Science Report" by Burtch Works (Burtch Works, 2019), which shows that data science professionals and hiring managers value not only technical skills but also knowledge of the industry and its history.
