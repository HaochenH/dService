## Scope

Scopes on our projects are generally limited. We split features into multiple versions and some of our projects are MVPs (Minimum viable products). This space is for you to demonstrate that scope and mention the features/screens you have included and excluded from the scope.

## Limitations

This is where to clarify the restrictions. It may seem similar to the scope but this space should be used to explain only the limitations. Be it technical or operational limitations, readers should get the idea of the limit they can reach through this sector.

E.g. “We are not able to do the feature A because there were not enough researches. We are waiting for the results of this version to include that feature.”
